This repo contains old code written for the game [Kal Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kal_Online). This is basically a collection of some game modifications like extra commands, server and clientside cheat protection, level extension, monster spawns, ... . Since Kal Online is a closed source game the only way to modify the game is via low level hooks, hence i used C++ and inline assembly. There is a more or less inactive development forum section on [Ragezone](http://forum.ragezone.com/f241/) were we shared our thoughts, code and ideas.

Used Tools:

 - [IDA Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/)
